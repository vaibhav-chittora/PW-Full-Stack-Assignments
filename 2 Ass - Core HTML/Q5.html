        <dt><b>HTML:</b></dt>
        <dd>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
            HTML describes the structure of a Web page.</dd>
        <dt><b>CSS:</b></dt>
        <dd>
            CSS is the acronym of “Cascading Style Sheets”. CSS is a computer language for laying out and structuring
            web pages (HTML or XML). This language contains coding elements and is composed of these “cascading style
            sheets” which are equally called CSS files

        <dt><b>Bootstrap:</b></dt>
        <dd>
            Designed to enable responsive development of mobile-first websites, Bootstrap provides a collection of
            syntax for template designs. As a framework, Bootstrap includes the basics for responsive web development,
            so developers only need to insert the code into a pre-defined grid system.

        <dt><b>Javascript:</b></dt>
        <dd>
            JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control
            multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what
            you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)
        </dd>
        <dt><b>React / React.js:</b></dt>
        <dd>
            React is a declarative, component-based, open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user
            interfaces. Whew! There's a lot to unpack there, so let's go through each piece of that definition.

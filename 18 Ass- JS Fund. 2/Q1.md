- The ternary operator in JavaScript is used as a concise way to write conditional expressions. It provides a shorthand syntax for expressing simple if-else statements, allowing developers to write more compact and readable code. The main uses of the ternary operator include:

-Assigning Values Conditionally: You can use the ternary operator to conditionally assign a value to a variable based on a condition. This is particularly useful for initializing variables or determining variable values based on certain conditions.
```
let result = (a > b) ? 'a is greater' : 'b is greater';

// here result would be a is greater  if a > b, otherwise it will be b is greater //


```

- Returning Values Conditionally: Functions can use the ternary operator to return different values based on a condition. This is commonly used in functions with simple conditional logic.

```
let x = prompt("Enter an integer");
function getDiscount(isMember) {
    return isMember ? 0.1 : 0;
}

```

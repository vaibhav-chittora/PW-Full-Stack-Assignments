- In JavaScript, the comma operator (,) allows multiple expressions to be combined into a single expression. It evaluates each expression from left to right and returns the value of the last expression. The comma operator is often used in situations where multiple expressions need to be evaluated sequentially, such as in a for loop's initialization or in function arguments.

 <!-- Here's an example demonstrating the usage of the comma operator: -->

```

let x = 1, y = 2, z = 3;

console.log(x); // Output: 1
console.log(y); // Output: 2
console.log(z); // Output: 3

```

Conditional statements, also known as control structures, are programming constructs that allow you to execute different blocks of code based on specified conditions. These conditions evaluate to either true or false, determining which block of code will be executed.

```

// Code Examples :

```


// ---> if condition
let x = 10;

if(x>8){
    console.log(x, "is greater than 8");
}

```


```
// ---> else condition

let a = 10;

if(a<8){
    console.log(false);
}
else{
    console.log("condition is not true")
}

```


```
// ---> else-if condition
let c = 10;
let b = 12

if(c<8){
    console.log(false);
}
else if(b%2==0 && c%2==0){
    console.log("both variables are divisible by 2")
}
else{
    console.log(true)
}

```

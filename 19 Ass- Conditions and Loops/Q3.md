Loops are control structures in programming languages that allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. They are essential for automating repetitive tasks and processing collections of data. Loops iterate over a sequence, executing the same block of code multiple times until a certain condition is met.

There are several types of loops commonly used in programming languages. Here are the most common ones along with their syntax and examples:


## for loop:
The for loop is used when you know how many times you want to execute a block of code.

Syntax: 
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
// Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

## while loop:
The while loop is used when you don't know how many times you want to execute a block of code, but you know the condition under which the loop should continue.

Syntax:let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}
// Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

## do-while loop:
The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but the condition is evaluated after executing the block of code, meaning the code inside the loop will always run at least once.

Syntax: let i = 0;
do {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
// Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

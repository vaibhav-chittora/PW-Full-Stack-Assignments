Absolute Positioning vs. Relative Positioning in HTML/CSS :-
In HTML, there are two position properties that can be used with the `<div>` element: `position: absolute;` and `position: relative;

Absolute Position: An element with position: absolute; will cause it to adjust its position with respect to its parent. If no parent is present, then it uses the document body as parent.
Written as -
{
position: absolute;
}

Relative Position: Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of an element with position: relative; property will cause it to adjust from its normal position. The other objects or elements will not fill the gap.
Written as -
{
position: relative;
}

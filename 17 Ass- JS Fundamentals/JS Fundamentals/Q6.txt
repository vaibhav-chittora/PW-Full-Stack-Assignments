Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript is crucial for improving code readability, maintainability, and understanding. Clear variable names communicate the purpose and intent of the variable, making the code more self-explanatory and easier to comprehend for developers. Here's why choosing meaningful variable names is important:

Readability: Descriptive variable names make it easier for developers to understand the purpose and usage of variables within the codebase. They provide context and clarity, reducing the time needed to decipher the code's functionality.

Maintainability: Meaningful variable names make it easier to maintain and modify code over time. Developers can quickly identify the intended use of variables and make changes without fear of introducing errors or misunderstandings.

Documentation: Well-chosen variable names serve as implicit documentation, providing insight into the code's logic and behavior. They help other developers (including future versions of yourself) understand the code without needing additional comments or explanations.

Reduced Errors: Clear variable names reduce the likelihood of errors and bugs in the code by minimizing confusion and misunderstanding. Developers are less likely to misuse or misinterpret variables when their names accurately reflect their purpose.

Example demonstrating the importance of clear variable names:
Consider the following code snippet with poorly named variables:

let x = 10;
let y = 5;
let z = x + y;

In this example, it's not immediately clear what x, y, and z represent. However, using meaningful variable names 
improves code readability:

let num1 = 10;
let num2 = 5;
let sum = num1 + num2;
In this improved version, it's evident that num1 and num2 represent numbers, and sum represents their sum. The code becomes more self-explanatory and easier to understand without needing additional comments or explanations. Choosing meaningful variable names enhances code clarity, making it easier for developers to work with and maintain the codebase over time.

A favicon, short for "favorite icon," is a small, iconic image that represents a website and is typically displayed in the browser's address bar or tabs when a user visits that site. It also appears in the bookmarks or favorites list. Favicon images are usually square and can be created in various file formats such as .ico, .png, or .gif.

Here's an example to illustrate what a favicon looks like:

Let's say you have a website named "Example.com." The favicon for this website could be a small logo, a stylized letter, or any image that represents the brand or content of the site. The favicon file is typically named "favicon.ico" or can be specified in the HTML code.

In this example, the "Example.com" favicon is a small square icon that might be a simplified version of the website's logo or a distinct graphic element associated with the brand. Users would see this favicon in the browser tab when they visit the website or when they bookmark it.

Favicons are a small but important aspect of a website's branding, providing users with a visual cue and making it easier to identify and distinguish between multiple open tabs or bookmarks.

HTML entities are special codes used to represent reserved characters and symbols in HTML. These entities are particularly useful when you want to display characters that have a special meaning in HTML, such as <, >, &, etc., without triggering their default behavior.

Here are five commonly used HTML entities:

1) &lt;: Represents the less-than sign <.
2) &gt;: Represents the greater-than sign >.
3) &amp;: Represents the ampersand &.
4) &quot;: Represents the double quotation mark " (used inside attribute values).
5) &apos; or &#39;: Represents the apostrophe (single quotation mark) '.
These entities ensure that the HTML parser doesn't interpret the characters as part of the HTML structure, helping to display them as content on the web page.

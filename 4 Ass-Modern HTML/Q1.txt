HTML5, the latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language, introduced several new features and improvements over its predecessors. Here's a list of key features in HTML5:

Semantic Elements:
<header>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, <aside>, <footer>: These elements provide a more semantic way to structure a web page.

Audio and Video:
<audio> and <video> elements allow embedding multimedia content without the need for plugins. They support various formats and provide APIs for controlling playback.

Canvas:
The <canvas> element provides a 2D drawing space through JavaScript, allowing for dynamic graphics and animations.

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics):
SVG is now a part of the HTML5 specification, allowing vector graphics to be embedded directly in HTML.

Local Storage:
The localStorage and sessionStorage APIs provide a way to store data on the client side persistently (across sessions) or session-specific.

Web Storage:
The localStorage and sessionStorage APIs allow for storing key/value pairs locally on the user's device.

Geolocation:
The Geolocation API enables web applications to access the user's geographical location information.

Web Workers:
Web Workers allow for the execution of scripts in the background, independent of the main page, enabling multi-threading in web applications.

WebSockets:
The WebSocket API facilitates full-duplex communication channels over a single, long-lived connection, improving real-time communication between clients and servers.

Form Controls and Attributes:
New input types (date, email, url, etc.) and attributes (such as placeholder, required, pattern) enhance form creation and validation.
